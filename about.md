## Introduction

**Marianne** is a website providing a wide range of tools for learning the **French** language and culture:

* It shows *statistics* on the language obtained via the [Esprit](https://github.com/giancosta86/Esprit) data mining application, based on the [GLAWI](http://redac.univ-tlse2.fr/lexicons/glawi_en.html) lexicon.

* It includes links to valuable [external resources]({{ site.baseurl }}/links/)

* Last but not least, its [Facebook page]({{ site.facebookPage }}) is designed to provide language and culture tips

The name of the website is dedicated to [Marianne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marianne), one the most iconic French national symbols.


## About me

I started learning French at high school, back in the year 2000: since then, I have studied it year after year - getting DELF Scolaire certificates at [Alliance Fran√ßaise Bologna](http://www.afbologna.it) while I still was at high school.

I continued studying French on my own even while I was at University (Computer Engineering) and in December 2013 I managed to pass [DALF C1](http://www.ciep.fr/en/dalf/detailed-information-on-the-examinations) - an examination dedicated to fluency in French.

I love studying natural languages - in particular, I have also created another website while exploring [German](http://gianlucacosta.info/FarbigesDeutsch/).

For further information about me, please visit [my personal website](http://gianlucacosta.info/).
